# 🤖 Agents

A personal collection of prompts, skills, agent configurations, MCP setups, and markdown instruction files — organized and version-controlled so they're accessible from anywhere.

## What's in Here

This repo is a living library of reusable AI building blocks:

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Prompts** | Carefully crafted instructions for specific tasks and workflows |
| **Skills** | Modular skill definitions that extend agent capabilities |
| **Agent Configs** | System-level configuration files that shape how agents behave |
| **MCP Files** | Model Context Protocol definitions for tool and resource access |
| **Workflows** | Step-by-step workflow files for repeatable processes |

## Philosophy

> The best prompt is one you never have to write twice.

Everything here is built to be **dropped into any project** and work immediately — no setup, no boilerplate, no guesswork. Just powerful, reusable instructions that make AI tools smarter out of the box.

## Usage

Then load any file into your AI tool of choice as a system prompt, skill, or context file.
